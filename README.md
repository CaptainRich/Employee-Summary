## Project Objective
As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input:

1) When I am prompted for my team members and their information THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the user's input.
2) When I click on an email address in the HTML THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
3) When I click on the GitHub username THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
4) When I start the application THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
5) When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern, or to finish building my summary.
6) When I select the engineer option THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
7) When I select the intern option THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
8) When I decide to finish building my team THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
